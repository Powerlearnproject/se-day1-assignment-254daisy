# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principle,methods and tools to develop and naibtain high quality software system.
it important is that it enables creation of software application and system that power various aspect of model life . 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.development of programing langues
2.establishment of software engineering 
3.the advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.requirement- Gathering and document user needs and system requirment. 
2.design-creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
3.implementation-writing codes and building the software
4.testing-conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standard quality and functional requirment
5.deployment-realising the software to the users or customers
6.maintance-providing on going support,update  and enhancement to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a squence approach with distance phase flowing downward while agile is iterative and increnental approach focused on flexibility 
eg 
scenerios for waterfall  
Implementation and Testing
1.Thunderstorm in the Sky: Developers work diligently amidst the thunder and lightning, coding the software's functionality, like the power of nature unleashed.
2.Rainbow after the Storm: Testing engineers meticulously check the software's performance, revealing any flaws like the vibrant colors of a rainbow after a storm.

scenarios for Agile
 Sprint Planning
1.The team holds a meeting to plan the upcoming sprint.
2.They review the backlog of user stories and prioritize them.
3.The team estimates the effort required for each story and allocates them to team members.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.software developer is responisble for writing codes and implementing sofware solutions
2.quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and excuting test plans 
3.project manager overseas the planning ,execution and delivery of software project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

integrated development environment(IDEs) it a software that provides comprehensive tools for writing ,debuggingand testing code eg.visual studio,eclipse
version contral system(VCS)it a software for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g.git,subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.changing requirment
2.tight deadline
3.technical debt
strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.unit-testing modules of the software
2.integration-testing interactions between diffrent componet or subsystem 
3.system-testing the entire software system as a whole
4.acceptance -testing the software against user requirment to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
it crafting questions or statement to get the best possible responses from AI modelsit help to avoid geting confused answer by making you question clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what you needs 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective. 
tell me about cars 
tell me about the history of toyota L300
an improved prompt is more effective becauseyou will get the kind og response you want
